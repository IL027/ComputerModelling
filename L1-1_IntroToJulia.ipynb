    "Julia is an easy to use programming language appropriate for scientific and numerical computing. We chose to teach this module in Julia mostly because it has a very natural syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/julia_logo.png\" alt=\"Newton\" style=\"width: 250px;\" align=\"middle\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER:** This is *not* a \"Programming in Julia\" module. The choice of language is non-essential. If you are an experienced Python, R or Matlab user then we encourage you to reproduce (some of) the course material in those languages. (In other languages it would be more difficult.) But all assignments must be completed and submitted in Julia.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this notebook, we will setup our programming environment and learn some basic programming concepts that we need:\n",

    "### JLauncher Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the initial setup stage, and to ensure everybody works with the same environment, we will use an online service run by Warwick University's [Scientific Computing Research and Technology Platform (SCRTP)](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/).  Feel free to follow along now, or just watch and try it again on your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you haven't yet done so, create either an SCRTP account [https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/desktop/myaccount/](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/desktop/myaccount/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First Log-in:\n",
    "  * In a browser open the [IL027 JLauncher](https://mnf145.csc.warwick.ac.uk:8987/module/IL027)\n",
    "  * enter your SCRTP username and password and login by clicking on `Start Server`. \n",
    "  * The first time you try to log in, it can take a while. Occasionally, when there is too much web traffic on the server, it is possible that this process times out. In this case, simply wait for a few minutes and then try to log in again. \n",
    "  * Normally, the Jupyter notebook server should be launched automatically and open a new webpage. Make sure that you **do not** close the log-in window! If you have a pop-up blocker, then the Jupyter browser window will be blocked but there is a link in the log-in window that you can click instead.\n",
    "  * In the Jupyter browser window you should now see the presentation and assignment files for the IL027 module, that are ready.\n",
    "  * If anything goes wrong during setup, please check the module page for IL027 if somebody else has had similar difficulties. If there are no solutions posted yet, then please describe your problem on the IL027 Moodle discussion board and the TAs or lecturers will give you further instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a new notebook: \n",
    "  * In the Jupyter browser click **`[New]`** and then **`[Julia 1.1.0]`**. This will create a new Julia notebook.\n",
    "  * Note we will *always* use Julia v1.1.x throughout this module. At the level of this module it only differs marginally from the latest Julia version (1.3.0 at time of writing this).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can now start entering Julia code. We will learn more about notebooks and Jupyter as we go along. For now, copy-paste the following code into a cell and then press `[SHIFT]+[ENTER]`:\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "using Plots; plotly()\n",
    "x = 0.0:0.01:2*π\n",
    "plot(x, exp.(sin.(2*x)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will take a little while to execute because the `Plots` library takes a long time to load. (Work is already underway by the Julia developers to improve this.) You may also see some INFO or WARNING messages, which you can safely ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open a Lecture Notebook: \n",
    "  * In the Jupyter browser click (e.g.) on `L1-1_IntroToJulia.ipynb` (**this** notebook), then a new browser window will open. This notebook will be read-only to make sure that you don't accidentally overwrite the original. \n",
    "  * To edit or execute, first click on **`[File]`** then **`[Make a Copy..]`**, which you can then rename, e.g., to `L1-1_IntoToJulia-<yourname>.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Assignments: see instructions in `L1-Assignment.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAs will be able to help you in the drop-in session on Thursday if you have any difficulties with this setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "### First Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. See instructions in `L1-1_IntroToJulia` notebook to get started with JLauncher, Jupyter and Julia.\n",
    "2. **COPY** the `L1-1_IntroToJulia.ipynb` file, real through and execute the cells. Experiment by copying and/or modifying some code cells. Repeat for `L1-2_LinearAlgebra.ipynb`.\n",
    "3. Open the `L1-Assignment.ipynb` notebook, make a copy, then work through the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support \n",
    "\n",
    "* For non-technical support with the lectures and assignments (i.e. the Julia notebooks all work ok for you but some steps or ideas are unclear) please see the TAs in the drop-in session.\n",
    "* For technical support, the drop-in session is again the best place to get help, but throughout the week you can also post your questions on the IL027 Moodle discussion board. Please check first whether other students have had similar problems as solutions may already have been posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For support questions that are best asked by Moodle or the drop-in sessions we will not normally respond to personal emails.\n"
