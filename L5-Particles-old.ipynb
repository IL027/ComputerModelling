    "*** Aim: ***  Computer simulations are a powerful tool for modelling the real world. They are particlarly useful for modelling stochastic, interacting agents that move through space: these systems are very hard to treat mathematically. The goal of this lecture is to introduce stochastic, spatial simulations using diffusing and reacting particles as an example. The material covers many of the basics used for more complex simulational models in biology, chemistry, physics or sociophysics. \n",
