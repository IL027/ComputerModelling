    "Quantum mechanics is the set of rules which govern how microscopic systems, namely atoms, molecules and electrons, behave. In the first part of this brief introduction to quantum mechanics, we went over the basic postulates of quantum mechanics; in this section, we're going to look at some computational schemes which can be used to calculate allowed quantum-mechanical states (and their energies), and to propagate wavefunctions in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any knowledge of finite elements and grid-based solvers, some of the methods we discuss here might be familiar to you as spectral or pseudo-spectral methods; if you're not familiar with these terms, don't worry - the practical implementation of the grid-based methods we're using is very straightforward.\n",
