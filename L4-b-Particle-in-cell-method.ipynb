    "Computational plasma physics often involves large scale direct simulations. Direct simulation involves simulating low level equations that map directly to the underlying physics, rather than deriving simplified equations for a specific problem (such a looking at waves as we did in Part 1. To derive the waves you have to simplify the low level equations). This is very powerful and allows the simulation of arbitrary problems but is generally more computationally expensive. In this section we're going to very briefly introduce a type of code called the \"Particle in Cell\" or \"PIC\" simulation."

    "Now, a quick introduction to vector calculus! It isn't as bad as it sounds. Vector calculus is an extension to normal calculus that allows you to operate on vector fields. Here, we're only going to use two bits of differential vector calculus. It does use partial differentials, but for what we're looking at here there's a general rule that applies : a partial differential is calculated like a normal differential, but if you are calculating $\\partial f(x,y,z)/\\partial x$ you act as if $y$ and $z$ are constant. Similarly $\\partial f(x,y,z)/\\partial y$ requires that you hold $x$ and $z$ constant. So, as an example $\\partial (xyz)/\\partial y = xz$ and $\\partial (xz)/\\partial y = 0$ (equals zero here because $xz$ doesn't depend on y at all, so you're just differentiating a constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important, because the vector calculus *operator* that we're going to work with is defined in terms of partial differentials. The operator is called *nabla*, or *del* and is written as $\\nabla$ (for those of you that use Latex, that calls is \\nabla). The definition of $\\nabla$ depends on the coordinate system that you want to use, but in Cartesian co-ordinates it's very simply defined as\n",

As the name suggests the divergence represents the tendency of a vector field to diverge away from a point (or converge towards it). It tends to be large at sources of sinks of a quantity (so plotting the divergence of the flow of water in a draining bath would show a maximum at the plughole)\n",

    "\n",
    "This is called the *curl* and is also sometimes written as $\\mathrm{curl}(\\mathbf{f(x,y,z)})$. This one measures the amount of \"swirliness\" in a vector field. The curl produces a vector result just like the cross product does, so it has both a magnitude and direction. Going back to an emptying bathtub, the curl would also be a maximum at the plughole because the water swirls round as it empties. The direction will be either straight down the plughole or straight up out of it, depending on the direction that the water swirls as the bathtub empties (you can't predict this sadly because the direction of rotation is much more influenced by the design of the bath than the Coriolis force, no matter what the internet tries to tell you)"

    "Adding a single particle to the simulation isn't very hard at all. Because of the structure of the Lorentz force, you have to keep track of two velocities for the particle, $v_x$ in the x direction and $v_y$ in the y direction. You don't need to keep track of $v_z$ because there is no $E_z$ to accelerate the particle in that direction, and for the magnetic field to bend it in that direction through the $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ force you would need either $E_yB_x$ or $E_xB_y$ to be non-zero which doesn't happen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to keep track of the $x$ position of the particle though. In 1.5D modelling, it is assumed that everything is uniform and infinite in the $y$ and $z$ directions, so while you _can_ keep track of the particle's $y$ position (since it does have a $y$ velocity this will be changing in time) you don't use it anywhere in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to perform two integrations, first you have to integrate acceleration to get velocity and then you have to integrate velocity to get position. This is simple enough, but there are two things to worry about\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second order integration\n",
    "In order to get acceptable performance from these codes everything has to be done using the more accurate \"time centred\" or \"second order\" integrators. For the fields, this slightly changes the sequence above. Rather than doing half of the B update, then all of the E update, then the other half of the B update you split it completely. The new sequence is\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Update B to half timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Update E to half timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Move the particle (this goes here because E and B are now defined at the half timestep so you can use them to get a time centred estimate of the force on the particle)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Update E to the full timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Update B to the full timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to do the same thing for the particles and it's a little clearer, so we'll go through it in a bit more detail. The basic Euler integrator for $\\frac{\\partial f(t)}{\\partial t} = g(f(t))$ is written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n+1) = f(n) + dt \\: g(f(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    " where $n$ is the current timestep (corresponding to time $t$), and $n+1$ is the next timestep (time $t + \\Delta t$). Effectively this is assuming that when you integrate over a time $dt$ a \"good\" approximation is assuming that the value $g(f(t))$ is constant with the value that it has at the start of the timestep. You can immediately see that this is not going to give a perfect solution. In fact, as you shrink $dt$ the error in that assumption scales at the same rate. So if you halve $dt$ the error halves. You can do better. If you assume instead that using the constant value at the *centre* of the timestep (usually called $n+1/2$) then you can actually get to the point where halving $dt$ *quarters* the error in your integration. In fact it turns out that using the simple Euler integrator to get a prediction of the values at the half timestep and then using those values works very well indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n+1/2) = f(n) + dt/2 \\: g(f(n))\\\\\n",
    "f(n+1) = f(n) + dt \\: g(f(n+1/2))$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can do better than that, and there are a whole family of methods, collectively called Runge-Kutta methods that allow you to get higher order error terms ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods ). The classical one is a *4th order* method where the error scales as $dt^4$. The downside, as you can see above, is that you have to store the values at both the *$n$*th and *$n+1/2$*th timestep so the memory requirements go up. As you go to ever higher methods, this tends to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that the code below includes things that look a bit like this, but are different. It turns out that *any* \"decent\" approximation for $f(n+1/2)$ works well for giving you this property of \"second order accuracy\". So to integrate velocity and position, I could do\n",
    "\n",
    "$x(n+1/2) = x(n) + dt/2 * v(n)\\\\\n",
    "v(n+1) = v(n) + dt * F_{Lorentz}(n+1/2)\\\\\n",
    "x(n+1) = x(n+1/2) + dt/2 * v(n+1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see what happens with this if I rearrange just the updates for $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x(n) = x(n+1/2) - dt/2 * v(n)\\\\\n",
    "x(n+1) - x(n) = x(n+1/2) + dt/2 * v(n+1) - (x(n+1/2) - dt/2 * v(n))\\\\\n",
    "x(n+1) - x(n) = dt(v(n+1)+v(n))/2\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{x(n+1)-x(n)}{dt} = \\frac{v(n+1) + v(n)}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line of that is very similar to the Euler integrator but uses $\\frac{v(n+1) + v(n)}{2}$ for the velocity rather than just $v(n)$. While proving it is hard, you can easily imagine that $\\frac{v(n+1) + v(n)}{2} \\approx v(n+1/2)$, and this is demonstrated working below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going from grid to particle\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the $E$ and $B$ fields are defined on a fixed grid, but the particle (particles in a working code) move freely above them, not tied to any particular grid point. But to calculate the Lorentz force you need to know the fields at the particle position. There are entire research papers written on how to do this, and different approaches have different properties. The simplest two are \"nearest grid point\" where you simply take the E and B fields from the nearest location to the particle and \"cloud in cell\" where you assume that the field at the particle is linearly interpolated between the two nearest cells. Almost no working codes use \"nearest grid point\" any more for a variety of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of other subtleties that I'm completely ignoring here (such as for example the question of what exactly you do about the particle velocity when calculating the Lorentz force see https://www.particleincell.com/2011/vxb-rotation/ for example). The algorithm given below isn't one that anyone would use in a working code, but for the purposes here it works \"well enough\"."

   "source": [
    "What we have described so far is actually a real type of code, called a \"test particle code\". Particles are moved in electric and magnetic fields but don't change the fields by their motion. To add this feedback, you simply add back in the current $\\mathbf{J}$ term in Ampere's law. You then calculate the current by calculating $q \\mathbf{v}$ for each particle and adding them together (this is another one of those things that no-one does but almost works).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you have two problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Particle to grid\n",
    "The first and in some senses simplest problem is that the current is calculated at the particle position, but you want it on the grid with the E field in order to update Ampere's law. This is the reverse of the problem with getting the E and B fields to the particle location, and the solution is very similar. In fact, in order to get the right answer you can show that the function for moving data from the grid to the particle and the particle to the grid must be exact inverses of each other. This can be difficult to work out, especially with more complex functions, but conveniently the code tends to go very badly wrong if you do it incorrectly. (It sounds like I'm being sarcastic there, but there's nothing worse in computational physics than a subtle but important error. Something that fails dramatically and totally at least isn't leading you to do incorrect research.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise and convergence\n",
    "This is the bigger problem. In a real code with current feedback on the fields, one particle is useless (even in a test particle code you generally want more than one particle just in case you put your one particle somewhere that gives an atypical answer). You would like to simulate every particle in your plasma, but that is effectively impossible - no computer even close to large enough to do that for any interesting plasma has yet been built. So you have to use a smaller number of particles and have each one \"pretend\" to represent a larger number of real particles. This isn't a bad model - particles that are near each other will tend to experience similar forces so will tend to wind up in similar places and assuming that they wind up in *exactly the same place* isn't untenable. But it is only a \"tends to\". If you don't have enough particles then you can get a variety of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Your solution is noiser. Because of thermal fluctuations you only know the state of the plasma particles in a statistical way - there is inherant noise due to Brownian motion etc. In a PIC code this noise level is increased since you have fewer particles\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Nearby particles only \"tend to\" experience similar forces. If there's small scale physics that means that nearby particles *should* experience different forces you might miss it. You can improve this by increasing the resolution of your simulation grid (PIC codes obviously smooth forces over the scale of the grid because the $E$ and $B$ fields can't have structure smaller than the grid), and you can also increase the number of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The opposite problem. You can, by chance, have a particle that is in *just the right place to have something interesting happen to it*. In reality only a tiny number of particles would be in just that position, but because you are artificially linking them together you can get a massive overrepresentation of the effect. This can lead to you publishing an interesting result that doesn't actually happen. (This is very, very bad!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to all of these problems is what's termed *convergence testing*. Formally all of these integrators have the properties of consitency and convergence. That means that if you were to take an infinitely fine space grid, and infinitely short timesteps and an infinite number of particles (this is actually wrong because there are actually a finite number of real particles, but ignore this here) you will get the \"right answer\". That is it will give exactly the answer from the equations that we are modelling. You can't do that, but you can increase the resolution. If the answer only changes by an acceptable amount (what's acceptable is very subject dependent. You can tolerate a much bigger error in astrophysics than when you're building a particle accelerator) then you have much more confidence that your answer is right.\n",

    "that's a picture of the electron two stream instability. You start with two populations of electrons propagating in a 1D domain.
