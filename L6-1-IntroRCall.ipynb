    "# Lecture 6 -  A brief introduction to R and RCall \n",
    "\n",
    "Lecture 6 will be delivered Philippe Blanchard from [PAIS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/) (Politics and International Studies) and [Q-Step](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/q-step). In this short tutorial I will give a quick introduction to some computational techniques that he will be using in his lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we chose Julia as the programming language for the IL027 module it was because it provides a natural, easy to learn, syntax. In particular it makes it possible to perform non-trivial tasks with fairly elementary programming paradigms. E.g., no aspects of object oriented of functional programming are required. However, in many disciplines there are specific language that dominate, primarily due to access to specific libraries. For example, in many branches of computational modelling, scientific computing and numerical analysis, Matlab and Python have become the dominant players. In Statistics and Data Analysis on the other hand, the language [R](https://www.r-project.org) is the clear industry standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Philippe's lecture will require the use of some of these highly specialised R libraries which provide functionality that is not easy to replicate in Julia. Instead, we will simply call these libraries from our Julia notebooks. The purpose of this introductory tutorial is to show you how this can be done and talk a little bit about what happens behind the scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interested Students should also look at the related [`PyCall`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package. There are also similar packages for Matlab, Ruby, Java, C++ and many other languages, but we don't provide these interfaces on our Jupyter server. C integration is built in; cf. `ccall`."
